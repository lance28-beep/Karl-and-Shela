    content: `Who would've thought two Call center agents would end up being together?

Our story started back when were just starting our lives in the corporate industry.
I still remember a time where I bought her a peach mango pie from Jollibee and she totally ignored it, saying that she does not eat stuff like that. I got devastated that day, but did not end up ruining it. Since then, I swore to become her mortal enemy and a lifetime companion at the same time. Yes! Some people meet at parties, we met at the office! We went from being coworkers with a mutual appreciation for a good latte to best friends who couldn't get enough of each other. We shared hardships, success, fragmentation, laughters and even experiencing a life settling here at UK.

After countless lunch dates, movie dates, getaway travel, and a million coffee breaks, we realized it was only a matter of time before we'd be celebrating a wedding over the years that we've been together.`,
